[build]
  # Command to build your Next.js site
  command = "next build"
  
  # Directory (relative to root of your repo) that Netlify_FIRST_PARTY_BUILD_SYSTEM
  # will publish. For Next.js, Netlify's build system handles this,
  # typically using the .next directory.
  # If you were doing a static export (next export), you'd set this to "out".
  # But for standard Next.js with SSR/ISR, let Netlify's plugin handle it,
  # or specify ".next" if you want to be explicit for some reason, though often not needed.
  # Netlify automatically detects Next.js projects and uses the correct plugin.
  # publish = ".next" # Usually not needed as Netlify's Next.js plugin handles this.
                      # We'll omit it to rely on Netlify's default Next.js behavior.

[functions]
  # Directory for serverless functions, if you have any separate from Next.js API routes.
  # For Next.js API routes, Netlify handles them automatically.
  # directory = "netlify/functions"

# If using Next.js App Router (which this project does),
# Netlify's Next.js Runtime (v5+) is typically used and handles this well.
# The Essential Next.js Build Plugin is often automatically applied.

# You can specify the Node.js version if needed, e.g.:
# [build.environment]
#   NODE_VERSION = "18" # or your desired version

# For advanced Next.js features on Netlify, you might explore specific plugin configurations,
# but for a standard setup, this simple toml or even no toml often works.
